This python program will take in a list of integers and sort them, lowest to highest, by using the
bubble sorting algorithm!

I originally learned this algorithm in my Computer Science 1 (COP 3502) class my Freshman year. This class taught C so I 
programmed a python version of this algorithm to develop some python skills. 

Instructions for this program will be presented during runtime. No additional modules needed.

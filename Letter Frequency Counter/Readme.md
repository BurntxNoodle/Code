# Letter Frequency Counter

Input a string and find the letter frequency of each letter

##### How to run

(this was run on Ubuntu 18.04 using python3)

On command line: ```python3 freq.py```

The program will then prompt you for a sentence or a string. There can be spaces or punctuation but make sure all of the letters are lower case.

Here's a picture of the program being run with the string ```hello world```:

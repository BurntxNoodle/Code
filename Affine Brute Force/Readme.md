# Affine Ciphertext Decoder - Shows all 312 possibilities

In class, we learned about the affine cipher. To help with a homework problem with ciphertext encoded by the Affine encryption, I coded this up to go over all possibilities and brute force the text so I wouldn't have to do this by hand.

#### How to run

(Note: this was run on Ubuntu 18.04)

On command line: ```python3 AffineBruteForce.py```

Example of programming running:

The program will prompt you to input ciphertext that you want to decode.

### note: it assumes no spaces and uppercase lettering

The program will then output all 312 possibile combinations of all Alpha and Beta combinations. In this example the decoded text has alpha 5, beta 7 values.

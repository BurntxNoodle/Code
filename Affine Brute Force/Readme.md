# Affine Ciphertext Decoder - Shows all 312 possibilities

In class, we learned about the affine cipher. To better understand the encoding process, and to help with homework, I coded it up with python.

#### How to run

(Note: this was run on Ubuntu 18.04)

On command line: ```python3 AffineBruteForce.py```

The program will prompt you to input ciphertext that you want to decode.

### note: it assumes no spaces and uppercase lettering

The program will then output all 312 possibile combinations of all Alpha and Beta combinations. In this example the decoded text has alpha 5, beta 7 values.

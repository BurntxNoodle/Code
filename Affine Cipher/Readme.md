# Affine Cipher - python3.

In class, we learned about the affine cipher. To better understand the encoding process, and to help with homework, I coded it up with python.

#### How to run

(Note: this was run on Ubuntu 18.04)

On command line: ```python3 affine.py```

The program will then prompt you to input two integers (one at a time). Here's how it looks like:

After, the program will prompt you to input the string you want to encode. It is assumed that all letters will be lower case and that there will be no spaces.

The program will then give you the encrypted string.

Here's how the full program looks like. We will encode the string ```defendtheeastwallofthecastle``` using the keys ```a = 5``` and ```b = 7```.

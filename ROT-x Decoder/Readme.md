### Rotation decoder - Rotates to all 25 possibilities

I wrote this program to help decode a ROT-x encoded message where x is the amount of rotations. For this program, it is assumed the string inputted will not contain any uppercase or spaces. 

To run the program, do ```python3 ROTx.py```. (tested using Python3)

The program will then prompt you to input an encoded message, after which, it will spit out all 25 possibilities.

Here's an example of the program run to help decode a message:

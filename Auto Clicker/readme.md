This python program is basically an auto clicker that is customizable at run time by the user! The program will
give you detailed instructions when you run it.

The user will be able to customize:
1. Number of locations the user wants to click (in order)
2. Whether each location is a right or left click
3. Time delay between each click
4. The number of times each location will be clicked.

This program uses the pyautogui module.

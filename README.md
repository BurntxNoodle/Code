# Code/Projects

Here lies all the extra code I worked on my free time. Usually to learn a program and get down the fundamentals, I would write some code for that language. Or if I see a problem that I can fix with a coding project, I'd try to code it up. Specifically this repository will contain all code I worked on, whether it's small projects, to simple alogirthms in a different language I'm not accustomed to, to exploits I've written for CTFs, etc. 

Read the ```README.md```s as it may contain things you need for the code to run without problems (such as version, modules, etc.)

Some of them are incomplete, and I'll get back on it soon.

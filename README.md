# Code/Projects

Here lies all the extra code I worked on my free time. Small projects, simple alogirthms, to exploits I've written for CTFs, etc. 

The projects that aren't really involved in shellcode (code/projects that I did for fun) have ```README.md```s as it may contain things you need for the code to run without problems (such as version, modules, etc.)

Some of them are incomplete, and I'll get back on it soon.

### Below is a list of code/projects that are uploaded in this respository for ease of use:

#### Shell Code/Exploits used in CTFs and Wargames
